# deconv_pitfalls
Code to generate figures presented in *On the use of calcium deconvolution algorithms in practical contexts*
by Mathew H. Evans, Rasmus S. Petersen and Mark D. Humphries. 

Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/871137v1

To run the code, download/clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/mathewzilla/deconv_pitfalls.git`

then download the data (on figshare due to size):
https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11695479

N.B. the above data underly the figures. The original data can be found here:
http://crcns.org/data-sets/ssc/ssc-2


Put the data in a folder called /Data in the deconv_pitfalls directory.

Change working directory in Matlab to deconv_pitfalls and run `RUN_ME.m`. 

Alternatively, run each figure script in turn 'Figure_1', 'Figure_2' etc in turn. Figures will be saved in a directory called Fig_panels.
